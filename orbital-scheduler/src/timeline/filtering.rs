//! [`SchedulerTimelineFiltering`] — timeline filtering (not yet shipped).

use leptos::prelude::*;
use orbital_macros::component_doc;

use crate::DeferredFeatureNotice;

/// Built-in timeline event filtering is not yet available in Orbital.
///
/// # When to use
///
/// - Planning filter-by-resource or filter-by-date-range UX on Gantt timelines
/// - Documenting the intended catalog entry until the feature ships
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Filter [`PlannedEvent`] and [`ScheduleResource`] collections before binding them to
/// [`SchedulerTimeline`], or push predicates into your [`SchedulerDataSource`] fetch.
///
/// # Best Practices
///
/// ## Do's
///
/// - Narrow `resources` first when users pick a team — drop unrelated lanes before render.
///
/// ## Don'ts
///
/// - Do not expect built-in filter chips on [`SchedulerTimeline`] today.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Not yet available
/// <!-- preview -->
/// ```rust
/// use crate::SchedulerTimelineFiltering;
/// view! {
///     <SchedulerTimelineFiltering />
/// }
/// ```
